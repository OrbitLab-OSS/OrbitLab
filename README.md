# OrbitLab

OrbitLab is an AWS Console-style service suite for managing Proxmox infrastructure.

Key goals
- Provide a small, modular control plane for lab infrastructure and appliances that sits thinly on top of Proxmox.
- Offer manifest schemas and clients to validate and apply declarative configs synchronoized via PMXCFS.
- Expose a lightweight web UI and APIs for inspection, management, and automation not already provided in Proxmox.
